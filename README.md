**Objective**
===
Build a well-designed, responsive news feed web app using the [newsapi](https://newsapi.org) api.
  * Follow Component architecture and modular thinking
  * Clean code and project, attention to detail
  * Design (a11y, semantic, usability, empathy)
  * Working funtionality

**Steps Taken**
===
Use component architecture to create a news application that will search within a selected category. The default category on page landing is general. Discover how to use the newsAPI. Create different fetch endpoints depending on category and search term. Have the results show no more than 20 per page. This took me around 13 hours to complete.


**Changes / Reflection**
===
My first time using component architecture, so I struggled with how each componenet relates to one another in the DOM. I could not figure out how to link local images within the components. I appreciate how organized this method is and look forward to using it more in the future. NewsAPI has endpoints that are rather limiting. I wanted to be able to search within categories, and this only works using the "top-headlines" endpoint, which has much more limited number of results than the "everything" endpoint. Due to the limited number of results, I could not limit the country to only US.
